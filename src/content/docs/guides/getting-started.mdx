## Installation

To get started with ShulkerScript, you need to install the ShulkerScript CLI.
You can either [download](#download-from-github) the latest release from the GitHub releases page or [build it from source](#building-from-source).

### Download from GitHub
<Steps>
1. Go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/moritz-hoelting/shulkerscript-cli/releases) and download the latest release for your platform.
2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Move the extracted binary to a directory in your PATH.
4. Test the installation by running
    ```bash
    shulkerscript --version
    ```
    You should see the version of the CLI printed to the console.
</Steps>

### Building from source
<Steps>
1. Make sure you have [Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs) installed.
2. Install the CLI by running
    ```bash
    cargo install --git https://github.com/moritz-hoelting/shulkerscript-cli.git
    ```
3. Test the installation by running
    ```bash
    shulkerscript --version
    ```
</Steps>

## Creating a new project
<Steps>
1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Navigate into the directory.
3. Run
    ```bash
    shulkerscript init
    ```
    This will create a new ShulkerScript project in the current directory.
4. Open the `pack.toml` file in your favorite text editor and configure the project to your liking.
</Steps>

The project structure should look like this:
<FileTree>
- src/
  - main.shu
- .gitignore
- pack.toml
- pack.png
</FileTree>

:::note
All files in the `src` directory with the `.shu` extension will be processed and neccessary functions generated.
:::

## Writing your first script
After opening the file `src/main.shu` in your favorite text editor, you should see the following content:
```shulkerscript title="src/main.shu"
namespace "your-name";

#[tick]
fn main() {
    /say Hello, world!
}
```
The annotation `#[tick]` tells the compiler that this function should be executed every tick.
Every line that starts with a `/` is a command that will included in the output. You can add as many commands as you like.
To begin with, you can change the message in the `/say` command to something else.

:::caution
Only functions annotated with `#[tick]`, `#[load]`, `#[deobfuscate]` or called from generated functions will be included in the output.
:::

## Building the project
<Steps>
1. Navigate into the project directory.
2. Run
    ```bash
    shulkerscript build
    ```
    This will compile the project and output the result to the `dist` directory.
3. Alternatively you can run
    ```bash
    shulkerscript watch
    ```
    to automatically rebuild the project when a file changes.
</Steps>

## Distributing the project
<Steps>
1. Navigate into the project directory.
2. Run
    ```bash
    shulkerscript package
    ```
    This will create a ZIP archive containing the compiled project.
3. You can now distribute the archive to your users.
</Steps>
