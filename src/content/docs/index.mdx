<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Simple Syntax" icon="seti:html">
        The syntax is similar to other programming languages, making it easy to
        learn, while at the same time providing powerful features not found in
        `.mcfunction` files.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Easy Functions" icon="add-document">
        Generate multiple function files from a single source file, and call
        them from Minecraft or other ShulkerScript files.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Written in Rust" icon="seti:rust">
        Fast compile times and a small binary size make ShulkerScript a great
        choice for your next project.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Contribute to this project" icon="github">
