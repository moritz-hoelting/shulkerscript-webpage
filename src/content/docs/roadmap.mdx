<Steps>
1. **Multi-File Support**\
    Allow users to split their code into multiple files and import them into each other.
    This will work something like this:
    ```shulkerscript
    use "path/to/file.shu";
    ```
    And will import all the public  (`pub`) functions and variables from the file.
2. **Better Error Reports**\
    Improve the error reports to be more helpful and easier to understand.
3. **Package CLI-command**\
    Add a command to the CLI to package the code into a zip file that can easily be distributed.
4. **Variables & Constants**\
    Add support for variables and constants. Constants can be any type (string, number, etc.) and 
    can be passed from function to function. They will be processed by the compiler. Variables will be
    mutable and can be changed at any time, and are stored as entries in minecraft scoreboards.
