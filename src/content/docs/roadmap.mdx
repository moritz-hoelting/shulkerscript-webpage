<Steps>
1. **Enhanced Multi-File Support**\
    Allow users to import all public functions from other files without specifying each name.
    This will work something this:
    ```shulkerscript
    from "path/to/file.shu" import *;
    ```
2. **Variables & Constants**\
    Add support for variables and constants. Constants can be any type (string, number, etc.) and 
    can be passed from function to function. They will be processed by the compiler. Variables will be
    mutable and can be changed at any time, and are stored as entries in minecraft scoreboards.
3. **Your Ideas**\
    Do you have an idea for a feature that should be added to ShulkerScript?
    Let us know by opening an issue on GitHub or writing a mail! Links can be found in the upper right corner of the page.
