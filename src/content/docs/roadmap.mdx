<Steps>
1. **Enhanced Multi-File Support**\
    Allow users to import all public functions from other files without specifying each name.
    This will work something this:
    ```shulkerscript
    from "path/to/file.shu" import *;
    ```
2. **Better Error Reports**\
    Improve the error reports to be more helpful and easier to understand.
3. **Tag support**\
    Add a way to define tags in the project and use them in the code. 
    This will eliminate the need for providing tags in the asset directory.
4. **CLI watch subcommand**\
    Add a watch subcommand to the CLI that will watch the project directory for changes and automatically compile the project.
5. **Variables & Constants**\
    Add support for variables and constants. Constants can be any type (string, number, etc.) and 
    can be passed from function to function. They will be processed by the compiler. Variables will be
    mutable and can be changed at any time, and are stored as entries in minecraft scoreboards.
